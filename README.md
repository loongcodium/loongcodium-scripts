# loongcodium scripts

Scripts for the loongcodium project.

## Usage

Run the scripts in the `scripts` folder with `uv run scripts/${NAME}.py`. You can also use a URL directly, for example: `uv run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loongcodium/loongcodium-scripts/refs/heads/main/scripts/${NAME}.py`.

To use the scripts without `uv`, check the headers of the `.py` files and set up the corresponding virtual environments.

To get help, run a script with the `--help` flag.
